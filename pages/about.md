#### **About Me**
Hello everyone,

My name is Dimas Vito(aka. NoSignal), and I am 22 years old. I am currently a student majoring in Civil Engineering. I have a strong interest in electronics and am always excited to learn new things every day.

In my spare time, I enjoy developing my skills in electronics, whether through personal projects or by deepening my knowledge. I also enjoy spending time with friends and family and engaging in activities that help me grow personally and professionally.

One of my main goals is to improve my skills in electronics, build a career in this field, and make a positive impact through technology. I’m very happy to be here and look forward to getting to know all of you better and learning from each of your unique experiences.

For anyone interested in discussing or sharing ideas about technology and electronics, feel free to connect with me on Discord, especially in the [DBAI](https://dbai.team/discord) community. I’m active there and open to discussions and sharing insights. Thank you!
